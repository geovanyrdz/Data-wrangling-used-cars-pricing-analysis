# ðŸš— Used Cars Pricing Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **data wrangling and analysis of used car prices** using a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and derive meaningful insights that can help in understanding the factors influencing car prices.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- The dataset contains information on various used cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, price, and other relevant attributes.
- **Source:** _(Specify if publicly available)_
- **Size:** _(Mention the number of records and features)_

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
